# This project is a collection of mathematical games.
# The user is required to answer the question. 
# To win you need to answer 3 questions correctly.
# With one wrong answer, the game ends with a loss. 
# There are 5 types of tasks: addition, subtraction and multiplication - brain-calc;
# determination of an even or odd number - brain-even;
# finding the greatest common divisor - brain-gcd;
# definition of a prime number - brain-prime;
# search for a missing number in an arithmetic progression - brain-progression.

# To install the game-package, use "make install" on the command line.
# To start the game, select the name of the game and use the commands mentioned above. 
# For example: 
#  $ brain-even
